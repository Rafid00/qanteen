Collard Greens

Using a non-stick pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium to medium-high heat. 

Add the chopped collard greens. You want to hear a crackle when they touch the oil. Let it crackle for about 30 seconds, add salt, and stir. 

Reduce the heat to medium and keep stirring for about 4 minutes. 

Add red pepper flakes and garlic and stir for another minute or so. Just make sure the garlic doesn’t turn brown.

Remove the collard greens from the pan, squeeze some fresh lemon juice over it, and set aside.

Salmon

Place the salmon steak skin side down on your cutting board and use a paper towel to dry off any excess moisture. 

Pour honey on top (use your hands or a brush and evenly coat the fish’s surface). Add salt and pepper.

Use a paper towel to wipe clean the pan you used for the collard greens and heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat. 

Add the salmon with the skin side up. Yes, skin side up. That will achieve an incredible sear on the skinless side. Just make sure when you put the fish in the hot pan, do not move it for about 4 minutes.

Reduce heat and cook for another 4 minutes skin side down, to get the inside just slightly cooked (opaque), with still a little translucency in the center. The internal temperature should read 125°F.

Place on a bed of collard greens and serve immediately.","['10-oz bunch of collard greens, central ribs removed and sliced into bite-sized strips', '2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil', '1 tsp kosher salt', '2 cloves garlic, minced (2 Tbsp)', '1/4 tsp red pepper flakes', '1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice', 'Two 6-oz salmon steaks (or a 12-oz steak, cut into two after cooking)', '1 Tbsp honey', '1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1697553-556x370.jpg,"['lunch', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner']"

Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large ""gumbo pot"" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.
Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called ""dead man,"" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).
Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.
Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.
Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.
Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.
Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.
Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.
Skim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.
To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.","['2 pounds fresh or frozen medium-size shrimp, in shells if possible, for stock', '1 dozen fresh or frozen blue crabs, cleaned and shells removed (substitute: 2 pounds fresh crabmeat, crawfish, oyster, or turtle)', '4 stalks celery, chopped', '½ cup chopped parsley', '2 green peppers, chopped', '1 large onion, chopped', '1 cup chopped green onions', '4 cloves garlic, chopped', '3 bay leaves', '1 ounce tomato paste', '4 teaspoons vegetable oil or shortening', '½ cup flour', '2 teaspoons salt', '2 teaspoons ground black pepper', '½ teaspoon dried thyme', '1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce', '1 can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped', 'All the Tabasco sauce you can handle', 'Creole seasoning to taste', '1 pound andouille, turkey, kielbasa or smoked sausage, cubed', '2 tablespoons filé powder', '1 pound fresh or frozen sliced okra', '1 bag Louisiana rice (or white rice)']",,"['lunch', 'soup', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner']"

I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic.
Along with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl.
Then I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside.
See?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm
And get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface.
Im going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down!
Then cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown.
I even brown each tip, like so.
Finally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time.
The house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check.
Oh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a
Oven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in.
I make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing
Then chopping my cucumber.
I throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper
And I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do.
When my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend.
I spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see.
We purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept.
I had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.  Every few minutes or so, I toss it afresh; this reactive base quick-pickles my onion slices transforming the flavor from pungent to perky sweet.
For the last 10 minutes of cooking my roast, I remove the foil from the top to expose the skin to the heat.  I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp.
Meanwhile, my onions have pickled
And Ive layered my baby spinach over them
Before I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan.
I toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch.
My pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender.
This hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold.
Topped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.  This is an elegant, delicious dinner that welcomes the first breezes of early spring  through freshly re-opened windows.

Start by roasting the beetroots. Clean the beets of all mud and trim the stems. Wrap each beet tightly in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender.
While the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside.
Clean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.
As the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.
While the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside.
When the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing.
Slice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink.
Serve by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets.
I like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese.
Garnish with the orange zest.
Trickle the vinaigrette over the salad.
Best served immediately.","['500g ( - 1.1 pound) of duck breast meat (about 2slabs) – skin left on', '300g ( - 1/2 pound +) baby beets or beetroot', 'zest of 1 orange', '2 teaspoons honey', '1 teaspoon salt', '3 cups of rocket or arugula greens', '4 tablespoons of toasted almond flakes or pine nuts', '1 can of mandarin orange segments (drained)', 'Bunch of fresh mint or basil', 'Shaved parmesan cheese or crumbled goat or feta cheese', 'Juice of 1 orange (about 6 tablespoons)', '2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil', '4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar', 'salt and pepper to taste']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/664960-556x370.jpg,"['side dish', 'lunch', 'main course', 'salad', 'main dish', 'dinner']"
