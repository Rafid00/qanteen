2.When the oil is hot add the meat, it should sizzle  thats good. Leave it to brown on one side and then turn it with your spoon so that it browns. If you stir or move it too soon it will stick.
3.Add the onion, carrot, ginger, garlic and chili. Turn the heat to medium, cover the pan and allow to sweat for a couple of minutes. You will notice that this process creates steam which lifts off the colour at the bottom of the pan  this is what you want because that colour is flavour.
4.Add the rest of the ingredients, bring to a good simmer, then turn down the heat to a medium/low, cover your pan.
5.I like to stay around for a little while to check that it is simmering gently. The reason being if the heat is too low it will not cook and if it is too high the meat will not tenderize.
6.Once you get it to a gentle simmer, cook until the meat is soft, checking only occasionally to make sure its not drying out. If it does, this probably means that your heat is too high  add a little water and adjust the temperature.
7.Check for seasoning before serving.",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/660257-556x370.jpg

Cook the rice three to four hours until you get a thick porridge consistency.
As the porridge is finishing, prepare the remaining ingredients.  In a large pan, saut the garlic and ginger for about ten seconds in canola or gape-seed oil over medium heat.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Spray a 13 x 9 pan with non-stick spray.  Drop biscuit dough by teaspoons in the bottom of pan, spacing evenly.  It's OK if there is space between the dough--it will expand as it's cooked.  Top with ground beef mixture and dot with the ricotta cheese mixture.  Bake at 375 for about 20 min or until biscuits are puffed and beginning to get golden brown.
Top with mozzarella and provolone cheeses and distribute pepperoni slices evenly over top, increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.  Return to oven and bake until cheeses are melted and beginning to bubble.  This should take about 10 minutes.
