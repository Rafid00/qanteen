Drain the noodles and rinse in cold water, so they’ll stop cooking. Cooked ramen should be springy but not spongy. 

Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over high heat in a sauté pan and brown the ground pork. Use a wooden spoon to break apart any clumps. Do not season the meat with salt and pepper. 

Cook the pork until it’s browned or even let it cook until it’s crisp, your preference. 

After about 8 minutes, the pork should have nicely browned and can be removed from the pan. 

Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil to the same pan and sauté the celery and/or any other vegetable you’re using for about two minutes.

Add garlic for another 30 seconds. 

Add reserved pasta water to the pan and stir in three tablespoons of oyster and soy sauce each. 

Use a wooden spoon to scrape off the burnt pork bits (the best stuff) from the bottom of the pan. 

Add the pork back into the pan and then add the noodles.

Finally, add some heat like hot sauce, chili paste, sriracha, hot pepper flakes, etc, and mix everything well. 

Sprinkle with some chopped cilantro, garnish with lime wedges, and serve. I love to squeeze some lime juice over everything.

You can use snapper, dory, kingklip or hake.
I like to cut away the belly because its alot thinner in thickness. Cut the steak portion into large chunks. They will shrink when cooked, so dont cut too small a piece.
I dont waste the belly parts. I like to roll them up. And then tie the roll of belly fish meat with a single strand of chive, so that it will look as chunky as the rest of the fish meat.
Set aside the prepared fish.
Prepare the red capsicum. Slice off one end.
And then slice off the other end. This will give you a tube. Slide a knife around the inside walls of the red capsicum. Remove the inner seeds and membrane. Slice the hollow tube of red capsicum into half and then slice into thin strips.
Grate or mince some peeled ginger to get approximately 1 tablespoon of ginger.
Prepare a handful of spices/herbs  2 stalks of lemon grass, 10 lime leaves and a handful of curry leaves.
Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a pan.
When the oil is hot, add 3 tablespoons of red curry paste of your choice.
I always use the A1 brand from Singapore. Find a good curry paste that works for you where you are, and then stock your larder with it!
Stir fry the paste in the hot pan for a minute.
Add the ginger. Add the garlic. Stir fry well to combine.
Add the lemon grass, lime leaves and curry leaves. Stir well to combine.
Add 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir well to combine and dissolve the tamarind.
When the curry paste is nice and fragrant, about 1 to 2 mins later, add 3 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine.
Add 400ml of coconut cream. Every brand of coconut cream is different. Some are thicker than others. But dont add water at this point. And dont use coconut milk instead of cream or light coconut milk. Its not the same.
Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.
When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.
When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.
As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.
When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine.
Dish out the fish curry gently because the fish may flake or break up.

Leave out about 1 1/2 cups of tiny broccoli florets for adding whole to the soup later. The rest of the broccoli will be pureed.

Bake your potatoes using an oven or microwave. Rough chop them and add them to your pot.

Rinse veal bones/meat with cold water and place in a 20 quart stockpot. If you have smaller pots, just split the recipe into two batches. Fill the pot with cold water, with twice as much water as there are bones. Slowly bring to a simmer, and gently move bones around occasionally. Let simmer for about 3 minutes. As the bones are simmering, blood, granular particles and other impurities should rise to the top, forming a brownish-grey scum. After 2-3 minutes, remove from heat, and quickly drain and thoroughly rinse the bones while they are still hot. Rinse and clean the stockpot.
Simmer Veal Bones/Meat:
Place the blanched and rinsed bones/meat in the stockpot, and add cold water until they are covered by at least 2 inches. Slowly bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Once the water has started to simmer, begin skimming off the fat, scum and other particles that rise to the top. Continue to simmer and skim until this scum begins to cease accumulating.
Add Aromatics:
Add all of your vegetables into the pot. Place the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a spice pouch or tied cheesecloth, and add to the pot.
Simmer & Skim:
Continue to gently simmer all the ingredients together for approximately 6-8 hours or more, until the stock tastes sufficiently flavorful and it seems that you have gotten the most out of the ingredients. Skim constantly during the simmering, and add water if the liquid level falls below the ingredients. Never allow the liquid to boil, or the fats can become incorporated into the liquid, creating a cloudy stock.
Strain:
Strain the liquid first through a colander or mesh strainer, then through a finer chinois or cheesecloth. Let only the liquid that passes through on its own, never pushing down on the strainer to squeeze liquid through. The liquid should be free of any particles, with only a minimal amount of grease/fat remaining. Repeat if necessary. Let the stock cool (preferably in an icewater bath), then place in refrigerator until it has solidified.
Degrease:
Take the refrigerated, solidified stock, and scrape any fat and grease that has hardened on the surface. This will look like a thin, whitish layer on the top.
Reduce and Flavor:
Reheat the stock until it has regained its liquid form, and taste it for flavor and strength. If it is weak, gently simmer off some of its water content and reduce to the desired strength & concentration. Add salt to taste. Depending on how much you reduce the stock, the recipe should yield approx. 8-12 cups.
Store:
After the stock has cooled, it is now ready to freeze or refrigerate for later use. I found it useful to freeze in 2 cup containers, along with an ice cube tray full of stock for quick, easy use.
Note: 
As an optional step to maximize the amount of stock the recipe will yield, you can also do a second extraction, or simmering of the ingredients, known as a remouillage (remoistening). Simply take the ingredients leftover from the first straining, and re-simmer them in cold water, again, for 6-8 hours or until ready. Then repeat the straining and degreasing process, and combine this 2nd stock with the first batch, and reduce/flavor as necessary.","['Water', '10 pounds meaty veal bones (shank, back, neck, knuckle)', '3 cups roughly chopped carrots (or parsnips)', '3 cups roughly chopped leeks (white and light parts only)', '2 cups roughly chopped yellow onions', '1 cup roughly chopped celery', '1 whole bulb garlic, halved & broken, skinless', '2 ounces italian parsley', '1 ounce fresh thyme', '2 bay leaves', '1/2 teaspoon whole peppercorns']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/665247-556x370.jpg,['side dish']
