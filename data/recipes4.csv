Heat oil in a 4  5 quart heavy pot over medium heat until hot but not smoking, then cook garlic, stirring until golden brown, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes with reserved juice, water, tomato paste, sugar and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in basil.
Eggplants and Stuffing: Bring a 5  6 quart pot of salted water to a boil over moderately high heat. Boil eggplants, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender when pierced with a pairing knife, 20  25 minutes. (Meg note: I stood over the stove and had to use a large slotted spoon to twirl the eggplants in the boiling water to cook both sides since they decided to float. Perhaps this was unnecessary? Let me know how you got them to sink or if you just left them alone and they turned out ok.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggplants to a colander to drain. Discard cooking water. When eggplants are cool enough to handle, about 15  20 minutes, halve eggplants lengthwise through the stem, but keeping the stem attached. With a small knife (Meg note: it is easier to cut around the edges of the eggplant with a pairing knife and use a spoon to scrape out the flesh), scoop out and reserve flesh, leaving 1/4-inch thick shells. Very finely chop flesh and transfer to a large bowl.
Bring rice and water to a boil in a 1-quart saucepan, uncovered, then reduce heat and simmer rice, covered, until water has be absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and add to the chopped eggplant.
Add breadcrumbs to the rice and eggplant mixture along with the garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine well.
Sprinkle inside of eggplant shells with remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Firmly pack the stuffing into the eggplant shells, about 1/3-cup. (You will probably have some stuffing leftover.)
Fry and bake eggplants: Position oven rack in the middle and preheat oven to 375F.
Heat 1-inch vegetable oil in a large 3  4 quart heavy skillet over medium heat until a thermometer reaches 320F and add 4  5 eggplant halves, stuffing side up. Fry, turning over once using 2 slotted spoons until golden brown, about 3  5 minutes on each side. Transfer stuffing side up to a paper towel lined plate to drain, then fry remaining eggplant halves in the same manner, returning oil to 320F between batches.
Spoon sauce into a 3-quart (139-inch) nonreactive baking dish. Add eggplants, stuffing sides up and bake, covered with foil, until sauce is bubbling, 20  30 minutes.

Place a large heavy bottomed pot on the stove top (like a Le Creuset pot).
Over medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp.  Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels.  Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.
Dry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.
Cut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.
Over medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.
Place the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.
After all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.
Then over medium heat add the diced Onions and Carrot and saute until soft, 5-7 minutes.  Add the minced Garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
Deglaze the pot by adding 2 cups of Cabernet Sauvignon.  As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom.  Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper.  Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes.
Add the Beef Short Ribs and any juices that collected in the bowl to the boiling pot.  Put them in snugly against each other and boil for 2 minutes.
Then place the lid on the pot and place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees undisturbed.  Don't peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone.
After 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid.  Prepare for a steam facial!  Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl.  Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone.  Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top.  Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it.  Remove as much as you can.  Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme.
Remember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!!  Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.  Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well.

To get started with this dish you will want to get two post of water boiling and cook your chicken breasts in one and your sausage in the other. I usually boil my chicken breasts for 15-20 minutes until the juices run clear when cut into, then cube them. For the sausage, slice it into bite sized pieces and boil for 10 minutes. Set aside after cooking to use later with the gumbo.


The roux is the most important part of a gumbo. If you don't get the roux right, you are probably not going to like your gumbo. There are many recipes you can try for a roux, but this is probably going to be one of the best you have ever had if you are a true gumbo fan. Let's get start making the gumbo.


Over medium heat in a large pot, add your olive oil. Allow to warm for a minute, and then add in the flour. Stir constantly until all of the flour has disolved and the mixture has a lot of tiny bubbles. Once you have reached that consistency it's time to add in your garlic powder. Allow to bubble, constantly stirring for one minute.


Gradually stir in the chicken broth and the beer, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a slow simmer. Add the celery, all tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and cajun seasoning. Reduce heat to a slow simmer, cover, and continue to simmer for 40 minutes, stirring often.


Mix the chicken and sausage into the roux mixture, cover, and cook for an additional 20 minutes, stirring often. Add in the fil powder, stir well.

Combine all tabbouleh ingredients and adjust salt and oil to your preference.  Cover and chill while the chicken is marinating  but first you should do like I did and dip a handful of pita chips in it.
When the chicken has marinated, prepare grill to medium heat.  Grill the chicken until done  at least 165.  I like mine very done, even with some crispy edges.
Half the pita bread, and split open.  Fill the halves with chicken, tabbouleh and finally the yogurt sauce.","['1 package pita bread', '1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts', '1 teaspoon paprika', '1 teaspoon coriander', '1/4 teaspoon cinnamon', '1 teaspoon cumin', 'of cayenne pepper', '2 teaspoons minced garlic', '1 teaspoon ginger', '1 teaspoon salt', '3 tablespoons olive oil', '2 bunchs fresh Italian parsley, chopped', 'cup quinoa, cooked', '2 cans petite diced tomatoes, drained and rinsed', '1 small yellow onion, diced', '2 lemons, juiced', '4 Mahjool dates, pitted and diced small', ""1/4 cup olive oil – (I didn't measure!)"", 'Sea salt', '1 cup Greek yogurt', '1/2 small cucumber, diced', '1 tablespoon mint', '1/2 lemon, juiced', 'Combine everything in a small glass bowl and chill']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/652414-556x370.jpg,[]
