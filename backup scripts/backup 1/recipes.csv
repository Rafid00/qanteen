You can use snapper, dory, kingklip or hake.
I like to cut away the belly because its alot thinner in thickness. Cut the steak portion into large chunks. They will shrink when cooked, so dont cut too small a piece.
I dont waste the belly parts. I like to roll them up. And then tie the roll of belly fish meat with a single strand of chive, so that it will look as chunky as the rest of the fish meat.
Set aside the prepared fish.
Prepare the red capsicum. Slice off one end.
And then slice off the other end. This will give you a tube. Slide a knife around the inside walls of the red capsicum. Remove the inner seeds and membrane. Slice the hollow tube of red capsicum into half and then slice into thin strips.
Grate or mince some peeled ginger to get approximately 1 tablespoon of ginger.
Prepare a handful of spices/herbs  2 stalks of lemon grass, 10 lime leaves and a handful of curry leaves.
Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a pan.
When the oil is hot, add 3 tablespoons of red curry paste of your choice.
I always use the A1 brand from Singapore. Find a good curry paste that works for you where you are, and then stock your larder with it!
Stir fry the paste in the hot pan for a minute.
Add the ginger. Add the garlic. Stir fry well to combine.
Add the lemon grass, lime leaves and curry leaves. Stir well to combine.
Add 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir well to combine and dissolve the tamarind.
When the curry paste is nice and fragrant, about 1 to 2 mins later, add 3 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine.
Add 400ml of coconut cream. Every brand of coconut cream is different. Some are thicker than others. But dont add water at this point. And dont use coconut milk instead of cream or light coconut milk. Its not the same.
Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.
When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.
When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.
As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.
When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine.
Dish out the fish curry gently because the fish may flake or break up.

To make the vadas, make a ball (slightly smaller than a golf ball) from the mixture and then flatten using the palms of your hand.  Heat the oil in a deep pan; it is crucial that the oil is hot enough- the vadas should sizzle as soon as they are dropped in the pan and should take around 2-3 minutes to turn golden brown. I suggest you test one first to ensure the correct temperature of the oil and to be able to check that they are cooked all the way through.

Rinse veal bones/meat with cold water and place in a 20 quart stockpot. If you have smaller pots, just split the recipe into two batches. Fill the pot with cold water, with twice as much water as there are bones. Slowly bring to a simmer, and gently move bones around occasionally. Let simmer for about 3 minutes. As the bones are simmering, blood, granular particles and other impurities should rise to the top, forming a brownish-grey scum. After 2-3 minutes, remove from heat, and quickly drain and thoroughly rinse the bones while they are still hot. Rinse and clean the stockpot.
Simmer Veal Bones/Meat:
Place the blanched and rinsed bones/meat in the stockpot, and add cold water until they are covered by at least 2 inches. Slowly bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Once the water has started to simmer, begin skimming off the fat, scum and other particles that rise to the top. Continue to simmer and skim until this scum begins to cease accumulating.
Add Aromatics:
Add all of your vegetables into the pot. Place the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns in a spice pouch or tied cheesecloth, and add to the pot.
Simmer & Skim:
Continue to gently simmer all the ingredients together for approximately 6-8 hours or more, until the stock tastes sufficiently flavorful and it seems that you have gotten the most out of the ingredients. Skim constantly during the simmering, and add water if the liquid level falls below the ingredients. Never allow the liquid to boil, or the fats can become incorporated into the liquid, creating a cloudy stock.
Strain:
Strain the liquid first through a colander or mesh strainer, then through a finer chinois or cheesecloth. Let only the liquid that passes through on its own, never pushing down on the strainer to squeeze liquid through. The liquid should be free of any particles, with only a minimal amount of grease/fat remaining. Repeat if necessary. Let the stock cool (preferably in an icewater bath), then place in refrigerator until it has solidified.
Degrease:
Take the refrigerated, solidified stock, and scrape any fat and grease that has hardened on the surface. This will look like a thin, whitish layer on the top.
Reduce and Flavor:
Reheat the stock until it has regained its liquid form, and taste it for flavor and strength. If it is weak, gently simmer off some of its water content and reduce to the desired strength & concentration. Add salt to taste. Depending on how much you reduce the stock, the recipe should yield approx. 8-12 cups.
Store:
After the stock has cooled, it is now ready to freeze or refrigerate for later use. I found it useful to freeze in 2 cup containers, along with an ice cube tray full of stock for quick, easy use.
Note: 
As an optional step to maximize the amount of stock the recipe will yield, you can also do a second extraction, or simmering of the ingredients, known as a remouillage (remoistening). Simply take the ingredients leftover from the first straining, and re-simmer them in cold water, again, for 6-8 hours or until ready. Then repeat the straining and degreasing process, and combine this 2nd stock with the first batch, and reduce/flavor as necessary.","['Water', '10 pounds meaty veal bones (shank, back, neck, knuckle)', '3 cups roughly chopped carrots (or parsnips)', '3 cups roughly chopped leeks (white and light parts only)', '2 cups roughly chopped yellow onions', '1 cup roughly chopped celery', '1 whole bulb garlic, halved & broken, skinless', '2 ounces italian parsley', '1 ounce fresh thyme', '2 bay leaves', '1/2 teaspoon whole peppercorns']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/665247-556x370.jpg,['side dish']

Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.
Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.
Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.
To assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.
Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.

Set aside.
Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.
Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.
Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.
Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.
Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.
Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.
In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.
Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.
Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.
With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.
Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.
Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread.

Break the capellini into approximately 3-inch lengths. Spread the pasta on a baking sheet, slide it into the oven, and toast, tossing occasionally with tongs, until golden brown, about 12 minutes.
2.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large pot (at least 5 1/2 quarts) with a lid over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt and cook, allowing them only to soften and grow aromatic but not brown, about 5 minutes. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the zucchini and another pinch of salt. Saut until the zucchini is well browned, about 5 more minutes.
3.Place the noodles on top of the zucchini mixture. Layer the asparagus and 1 cup of the cherry tomatoes on top of that and sprinkle in the smoked paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, and rosemary. Pour the red wine and  cup of water over the top. Toss as best you can with tongs; it will be hard at first because the noodles are stiff. Return the heat to medium and cover the pot.
4.Every 3 minutes, remove the lid and toss the pasta. The total cooking time will be 8 to 12 minutes. Toward the end, taste a noodle each time you remove the lid to see if it is done. If not, and there isnt any moisture left on the bottom of the pot, add a bit more wine or water, about 1/3 cup.
5.When the noodles are done to your liking, taste and make any final adjustments to the seasoning. Transfer to serving bowls. Garnish with the remaining 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, the parsley, and another grind of black pepper. Serve immediately.","['1 pound capellini or angel hair pasta', '3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil', 'Half alarge white onion, thinly sliced', '6 garlic cloves, minced', 'Kosher salt', '1 ½ pounds zucchini, diced', '1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch lengths', '1 1/2 cups halved cherry tomatoes', '1 tablespoon smoked paprika', '1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper', '2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves', '1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary', '1 1/4 cups red wine (I use an inexpensive Spanish Tempranillo), plus additional as needed', '1 1/4 cups water, plus additional as needed', 'Minced fresh flatleaf parsley leaves for garnish']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/655706-556x370.jpg,"['side dish', 'lunch', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner']"

Collard Greens
Using a non-stick pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium to medium-high heat. 
Add the chopped collard greens. You want to hear a crackle when they touch the oil. Let it crackle for about 30 seconds, add salt, and stir. 
Reduce the heat to medium and keep stirring for about 4 minutes. 
Add red pepper flakes and garlic and stir for another minute or so. Just make sure the garlic doesn’t turn brown.
Remove the collard greens from the pan, squeeze some fresh lemon juice over it, and set aside.
Salmon
Place the salmon steak skin side down on your cutting board and use a paper towel to dry off any excess moisture. 
Pour honey on top (use your hands or a brush and evenly coat the fish’s surface). Add salt and pepper.
Use a paper towel to wipe clean the pan you used for the collard greens and heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat. 
Add the salmon with the skin side up. Yes, skin side up. That will achieve an incredible sear on the skinless side. Just make sure when you put the fish in the hot pan, do not move it for about 4 minutes.
Reduce heat and cook for another 4 minutes skin side down, to get the inside just slightly cooked (opaque), with still a little translucency in the center. The internal temperature should read 125°F.
Place on a bed of collard greens and serve immediately.","['10-oz bunch of collard greens, central ribs removed and sliced into bite-sized strips', '2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil', '1 tsp kosher salt', '2 cloves garlic, minced (2 Tbsp)', '1/4 tsp red pepper flakes', '1 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice', 'Two 6-oz salmon steaks (or a 12-oz steak, cut into two after cooking)', '1 Tbsp honey', '1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1697553-556x370.jpg,"['lunch', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner']"

Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large ""gumbo pot"" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.
Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called ""dead man,"" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).
Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.
Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.
Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.
Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.
Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.
Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.
Skim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.
To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.","['2 pounds fresh or frozen medium-size shrimp, in shells if possible, for stock', '1 dozen fresh or frozen blue crabs, cleaned and shells removed (substitute: 2 pounds fresh crabmeat, crawfish, oyster, or turtle)', '4 stalks celery, chopped', '½ cup chopped parsley', '2 green peppers, chopped', '1 large onion, chopped', '1 cup chopped green onions', '4 cloves garlic, chopped', '3 bay leaves', '1 ounce tomato paste', '4 teaspoons vegetable oil or shortening', '½ cup flour', '2 teaspoons salt', '2 teaspoons ground black pepper', '½ teaspoon dried thyme', '1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce', '1 can whole peeled tomatoes, chopped', 'All the Tabasco sauce you can handle', 'Creole seasoning to taste', '1 pound andouille, turkey, kielbasa or smoked sausage, cubed', '2 tablespoons filé powder', '1 pound fresh or frozen sliced okra', '1 bag Louisiana rice (or white rice)']",,"['lunch', 'soup', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner']"

I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic.
Along with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl.
Then I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside.
See?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm
And get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface.
Im going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down!
Then cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown.
I even brown each tip, like so.
Finally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time.
The house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check.
Oh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a
Oven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in.
I make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing
Then chopping my cucumber.
I throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper
And I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do.
When my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend.
I spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see.
We purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept.
I had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.  Every few minutes or so, I toss it afresh; this reactive base quick-pickles my onion slices transforming the flavor from pungent to perky sweet.
For the last 10 minutes of cooking my roast, I remove the foil from the top to expose the skin to the heat.  I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp.
Meanwhile, my onions have pickled
And Ive layered my baby spinach over them
Before I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan.
I toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch.
My pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender.
This hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold.
Topped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.  This is an elegant, delicious dinner that welcomes the first breezes of early spring  through freshly re-opened windows.

Start by roasting the beetroots. Clean the beets of all mud and trim the stems. Wrap each beet tightly in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender.
While the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside.
Clean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.
As the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.
While the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside.
When the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing.
Slice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink.
Serve by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets.
I like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese.
Garnish with the orange zest.
Trickle the vinaigrette over the salad.
Best served immediately.","['500g ( - 1.1 pound) of duck breast meat (about 2slabs) – skin left on', '300g ( - 1/2 pound +) baby beets or beetroot', 'zest of 1 orange', '2 teaspoons honey', '1 teaspoon salt', '3 cups of rocket or arugula greens', '4 tablespoons of toasted almond flakes or pine nuts', '1 can of mandarin orange segments (drained)', 'Bunch of fresh mint or basil', 'Shaved parmesan cheese or crumbled goat or feta cheese', 'Juice of 1 orange (about 6 tablespoons)', '2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil', '4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar', 'salt and pepper to taste']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/664960-556x370.jpg,"['side dish', 'lunch', 'main course', 'salad', 'main dish', 'dinner']"

Heat oil in a 4  5 quart heavy pot over medium heat until hot but not smoking, then cook garlic, stirring until golden brown, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes with reserved juice, water, tomato paste, sugar and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in basil.
Eggplants and Stuffing: Bring a 5  6 quart pot of salted water to a boil over moderately high heat. Boil eggplants, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender when pierced with a pairing knife, 20  25 minutes. (Meg note: I stood over the stove and had to use a large slotted spoon to twirl the eggplants in the boiling water to cook both sides since they decided to float. Perhaps this was unnecessary? Let me know how you got them to sink or if you just left them alone and they turned out ok.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer the eggplants to a colander to drain. Discard cooking water. When eggplants are cool enough to handle, about 15  20 minutes, halve eggplants lengthwise through the stem, but keeping the stem attached. With a small knife (Meg note: it is easier to cut around the edges of the eggplant with a pairing knife and use a spoon to scrape out the flesh), scoop out and reserve flesh, leaving 1/4-inch thick shells. Very finely chop flesh and transfer to a large bowl.
Bring rice and water to a boil in a 1-quart saucepan, uncovered, then reduce heat and simmer rice, covered, until water has be absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork and add to the chopped eggplant.
Add breadcrumbs to the rice and eggplant mixture along with the garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine well.
Sprinkle inside of eggplant shells with remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Firmly pack the stuffing into the eggplant shells, about 1/3-cup. (You will probably have some stuffing leftover.)
Fry and bake eggplants: Position oven rack in the middle and preheat oven to 375F.
Heat 1-inch vegetable oil in a large 3  4 quart heavy skillet over medium heat until a thermometer reaches 320F and add 4  5 eggplant halves, stuffing side up. Fry, turning over once using 2 slotted spoons until golden brown, about 3  5 minutes on each side. Transfer stuffing side up to a paper towel lined plate to drain, then fry remaining eggplant halves in the same manner, returning oil to 320F between batches.
Spoon sauce into a 3-quart (139-inch) nonreactive baking dish. Add eggplants, stuffing sides up and bake, covered with foil, until sauce is bubbling, 20  30 minutes.

Place a large heavy bottomed pot on the stove top (like a Le Creuset pot).
Over medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp.  Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels.  Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.
Dry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.
Cut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.
Over medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.
Place the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.
After all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.
Then over medium heat add the diced Onions and Carrot and saute until soft, 5-7 minutes.  Add the minced Garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
Deglaze the pot by adding 2 cups of Cabernet Sauvignon.  As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom.  Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper.  Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes.
Add the Beef Short Ribs and any juices that collected in the bowl to the boiling pot.  Put them in snugly against each other and boil for 2 minutes.
Then place the lid on the pot and place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees undisturbed.  Don't peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone.
After 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid.  Prepare for a steam facial!  Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl.  Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone.  Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top.  Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it.  Remove as much as you can.  Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme.
Remember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!!  Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.  Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well.

On a baking sheet place the squash halves, spray with PAM and sprinkle with 1-2 tbsp garam masala. Place in the oven and BROIL till tender and charred- about 10-15 minutes.
While the squashes are roasting, in a large skillet, spray with PAM and add vegetable oil and set over medium heat. Add the cashews and saute until fragrant and slightly darkened. Add onions and peppers, sprinkle with black pepper and saute until soft, about 5-7 minutes. Once the onions and peppers are soft, but now brown, add the soaked basmati rice (make sure not to get any water in it!). Saute for 5-7 minutes. You want to toast the the rice.
Remove the squash from the oven and cool for a few minutes before handling. Score the squash into small cubes, WITHOUT cutting through the skin. Scoop the cubes out into a bowl and set aside. Keep the shell aside, DONT throw out!
Once the rice is toasted add 1 cup of water, pinch of saffron, cover and cook on medium-low heat, about 15 minutes. You want the rice to be cooked thru, not mushy so dont mix it around too much! Once the rice is cooked, add the cubed squash, tossing gently (you dont want the squash to break and mush around the rice). Add the Biryani paste and toss to coat. Mix in 3/4 of the chopped cilantro. Taste for salt and biryani flavor- it should be strong, spicy and aromatic.
In a small skillet, spray with PAM and set over medium-high heat. Add onion slices, and saute without breaking up the circles. Cook until brown-ish about 4-5 minutes. Set aside.
Fill each squash bowl with rice, just coming over the top. Top each one with an onion round and sprinkle with remaining chopped cilantro. Serve with yogurt or raita.
Biryani paste:
In a medium skillet, spray with pam, add oil and set over medium-high flame. Add onions and tomatoes, saute until golden-brown about 4-5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, chili powder and cilantro. Saute until vegetables are soft and fragrant about 4-5 minutes. Add the biryani paste and mix well, making sure all the veggies are coated. Remove from the heat and let cool (10-15 minutes).
In a grinder/food processor, add the biryani mixture and grind until smooth (slightly chunky is ok). Store in an air tight container.

To get started with this dish you will want to get two post of water boiling and cook your chicken breasts in one and your sausage in the other. I usually boil my chicken breasts for 15-20 minutes until the juices run clear when cut into, then cube them. For the sausage, slice it into bite sized pieces and boil for 10 minutes. Set aside after cooking to use later with the gumbo.
The roux is the most important part of a gumbo. If you don't get the roux right, you are probably not going to like your gumbo. There are many recipes you can try for a roux, but this is probably going to be one of the best you have ever had if you are a true gumbo fan. Let's get start making the gumbo.
Over medium heat in a large pot, add your olive oil. Allow to warm for a minute, and then add in the flour. Stir constantly until all of the flour has disolved and the mixture has a lot of tiny bubbles. Once you have reached that consistency it's time to add in your garlic powder. Allow to bubble, constantly stirring for one minute.
Gradually stir in the chicken broth and the beer, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a slow simmer. Add the celery, all tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and cajun seasoning. Reduce heat to a slow simmer, cover, and continue to simmer for 40 minutes, stirring often.
Mix the chicken and sausage into the roux mixture, cover, and cook for an additional 20 minutes, stirring often. Add in the fil powder, stir well. 
Once finished, serve over rice and with a side of french bread. So delicious!","['1 cup all purpose flour', '1 12oz bottle or can of beer (I prefer Michelob Ultra)', '1 bell pepper diced', '1/4 cup cajun seasoning in the seasoning aisle at your local grocery store, and if you are really looking for some flavor you can kick things up by adding an additional 1/4 cup of seasoning to make it a full 1/2 cup of cajun seasoning.', '1 10oz can diced tomatoes with green chili peppers (with juice)', '1 14.5oz can petite diced tomatoes (with juice)', '6 stalks of celery diced', '3 14.5oz cans chicken broth', '3 chicken breasts cooked and cubed', '1 cup extra virgin olive oil', '1 Tbsp filé powder', '1 Tbsp garlic powder', '2 Tbsp parsley', '1 package sausage cooked and sliced', '1 sweet onion diced']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1055614-556x370.jpg,"['lunch', 'soup', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner']"

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat. With the aid of tongs, sear the roll all over, including the ends, until nicely browned all over. While the meat is browning, heat the marinara sauce, garlic and wine in a Dutch oven or pan large enough to hold the size of the roll.  Place the browned braciole in the sauce and bring to a gentle simmer.  Cover and braise, over low heat until tender. The braciole in the photograph took 3 hours until a fork inserted into the meat slid in easily.
When tender, carefully remove the beef roll from the sauce and set on a platter. Let the roll cool for about 5-10 minutes and remove the string. Slice the braciole and serve with pasta or gnocchi with the sauce over the top and plenty of parmesan cheese.","['1 pound round steak (choose a solid piece without loose segments)', '4 slices prosciutto', '6 slices Genoa salami', '1 cup fresh bread crumbs', '1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley, minced', '1/4 cup grated parmesan or Romano cheese', '4 tablespoons olive oil', '3 cloves garlic, peeled and halved', '6 cups prepared marinara sauce', '1/2 cup red wine']",https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/648048-556x370.jpg,"['lunch', 'main course', 'main dish', 'dinner']"
